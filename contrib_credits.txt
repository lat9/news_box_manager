This contribution was written by geeks4u.com and I have left the original files list and notice
below intact.

I have updated this contribution, corrected the sql to work with the patch tool and fixed a few 
bugs as well as correct the code so it will now work with Register Globals off.


Installation instructions:

1) Expand the zip locally and go though the sub-directories named YOUR_TEMPLATE and rename
these directories to match the override diretory name in your particular installation. There are 4 
such directories so make sure you change them all or this contribution will fail to function.

2) Copy all of the files into your ZC installation. There are only additions, no files will be
replaced.

3) Paste the SQL into the Patch tool and execute it.

4) Paste the css additions to your stylesheet.css

5) Go to the News Box admin tool under Tools->News Box Manger to enter your stories and they will 
appear as soon as you select the option to publish them.


Known Caveats:

The javascript output has a few minor xhtml errors, perhaps someone with more javascript experience 
than I can suggest a fix here!

Enjoy!

| Do Not Remove: Coded for Zen-Cart by geeks4u.com                     |
| Dedicated to Memory of Amelita "Emmy" Abordo Gelarderes              |

Hello to everyone in the Zen-Cart community and my best regards to the Zen-Cart team and especially Kim.
It took a little while but finally I've managed to find enough time to modify the News Manager for ZC 1.2 and release it to the community.
I hope you will enjoy this release, which although functional is still far from finished.
I'm sure I'll be changing things and adding more functionality, but right now I just wanted to release it, because the News Manager has been highly anticipated by ZC users.
As you have noticed I dedicated this release to someone from our family that tragically past away while I was coding the News Manager. Please leave in place my notice of dedication.
As always your feedback is welcomed. Please post it on ZC website in Support Forum/Contributions/News Box Manager.
Furthermore I promise you that any donations will not be rejected. You can send them via PayPal to geeks4u_donations@netideas.org
Enjoy.

Warning!!! This below will modify the zen_configuration table and add two new tables to the database.

INSERT INTO `configuration` VALUES ('', 'News Box Character Count', 'NEWS_BOX_CHAR_COUNT', '200', 'Set the number of characters (bytes) that you want to display in the news preview box.', 19, 99, NULL, '2004-09-07 12:00:00', NULL, NULL);
INSERT INTO `configuration` VALUES ('', 'News Box Width in px', 'NEWS_BOX_WIDTH', '140px', 'Set the width of News Box to fine tune how it displays your news.', 19, 99, NULL, '2004-09-07 12:00:00', NULL, NULL);
INSERT INTO `configuration` VALUES ('', 'News Box Height in px', 'NEWS_BOX_HEIGHT', '160px', 'Set the height of News Box to fine tune how it displays your news.', 19, 99, NULL, '2004-09-07 12:00:00', NULL, NULL);
INSERT INTO `configuration` VALUES ('', 'Number of Shown News', 'NEWS_BOX_SHOW_NEWS', '10', 'Set the number of Shown News', 19, 99, NULL, '2004-09-07 12:00:00', NULL, NULL);

CREATE TABLE `box_news` (
  `box_news_id` int(11) NOT NULL auto_increment,
  `news_added_date` datetime NOT NULL default '0000-00-00 00:00:00',
  `news_modified_date` datetime default NULL,
  `news_start_date` datetime default NULL,
  `news_end_date` datetime default NULL,
  `news_published_date` datetime default NULL,
  `news_status` tinyint(1) default '0',
  `more_news_page` tinyint(1) default '0',
  PRIMARY KEY  (`box_news_id`)
) TYPE=MyISAM AUTO_INCREMENT=1;

CREATE TABLE `box_news_content` (
  `box_news_id` int(11) NOT NULL default '0',
  `languages_id` int(11) NOT NULL default '1',
  `news_title` varchar(64) NOT NULL default '',
  `news_content` text NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY  (`languages_id`,`box_news_id`)
) TYPE=MyISAM;

CSS changes:
____________

.newsInfo {
  text-align: left;
  font-style: normal;
}

.newsContent {
font-size: 1.1em;
}


Finally log in to admin, enable it in Tools/Layout Boxes Controller and add some news, because the news Box Manager will not show when there are no news to display :)
